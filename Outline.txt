I want to make art from images and math.
Inspiration from here https://github.com/esimov/triangle

Compute intensity image
Normalize intensity image

Convolve intensity image with gaussian kernel
OR
Convolve gradient of image with gaussian kernel
OR
Sqrt gradient of image
OR
Sqrt convolution of gradient of image with gaussian kernel

Add vertices to image based on probability
    if distribution(0,1) < intensityAtPoint
        Add Vertex
    what distribution do i use?

For each pixel_j whose nearest vertex is vertex_i
    set pixel_j's color to average color around vertex_i
